### Background...
- I am a **4th year** **Neurosceince** student 👩🏻‍🎓🧠
- I enrolled in this class because I want to develop my skills in **coding** 👩🏻‍💻 and learn to interpret **data** 📈 related to neuroscience.
- I have always been **fascinated** 🧐 by the brain and how and why people develop certain disorders or diseases, and I 💕 **love** 💕 the details of brain pathways, such as the ones that lead to addiction or loss of movement in limbs. 🦿
- My career plan is to get into **medical school** 🩺 and maybe become a neurologist? its still to early to decide on that 😅
